# Choquet integrals based on conditional aggregation operators in decision making and image processing, software implementation

This repository contains the software support for experimental study a novel generalized Choquet integral based on conditional aggregation operators in two areas – decision making and image processing.
Mentioned study is a part of the paper entitled "Choquet integrals based on conditional aggregation operators in decision making and image processing, software implementation".

The software support is divided into two folders for individual experiments:
- the folder "Decision making" included software application for computing generalized Choquet integral together with its manual. The application is designed for easy use in decision-making processes (see manual).
- the folder "Image processing" includes Java codes for the feature and blending phase used in edge detection. The blending phase has implemented codes for generalized Choquet integral (for more information see "Basarik, S., Borzová, J., Halčinová, L., Šupina, J.: Conditional aggregation-based Choquet integral on discrete space).
